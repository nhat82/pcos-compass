# pcos-compass: PCOS Cycle Tracker

## Description
A full-stack period and fertility tracking app designed to help women with PCOS predict cycles more accurately and log key reproductive health data.

Techstack: Flask, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL.

## 🧐 Why?
Me and many other women with PCOS often struggle with irregular cycles, making it hard to predict ovulation and fertility windows. Existing apps focus on regular cycles, doesn't provide accurate predictions and effcient tracking.  

This project is a personal solution built after surveying an active [subreddit /PCOS](<https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/>). You can track the survey from my post [here](<https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/1mq47hb/pcos_tracking_app/>)!
